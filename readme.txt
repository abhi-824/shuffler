This basically will be a shufflur for regular competitive coding questions with features like login, dashboard, frequency count, time graph, recording a20j questions that I have completed, avverage time for all levels by difficulty, and topic(would require an api from codeforces for that)
All the questions are taken through codeforces and 




Hey All, most of us are now focussing on competitive coding and this is the basic thing thing you might qwant to do to excel at that-
	CONSIDER IT AS A GYM
It might sound funny, but that's the truth. I got the top 100 handpicked problems from a trusted source(a20j.com, quora, peronal favourites) along with their difficulty level and made a website which gives you the daily dosage you might need for gaining experience with competitive coding.
Another important thing: It's still in development and I would be adding a personalised dashboard with features like frequency count, time graph, and even a community where you can share useful insights you got from a question or ask queries related to competitive programming in general.

If you want to contribute to this project, just try this website out and give me your ideas, and I would add you to the band which currently have just me.
